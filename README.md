# BilltasticJS

This is my final project for the last course I did. It's a bill management application which lets you create your own database filled with products and customers. Then, you can make orders to keep them tracked and order them by status (paid, unpaid, draft). 

There is a live version of my server at OpenShift, and you can download and test the app. Please, check it out! http://billtasticjs-alexhzr.rhcloud.com/

Note: if the server is down and you want to try it, feel free to contact me and I will re-upload the code to the server. OpenShift automatically shuts down projects which remain idle for several days.
